# Stirry
A very lightweight JavaFX automation tool.

Big thanks to [Renato Athaydes and the Automaton team](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/Automaton) for hints on how to grab an FX App.

Current features:

- Grabs the root node of your app
- Lets you search for Nodes using a predicate.

Examples of how to use it are [here](src/test/kotlin/com/lunivore/stirry/StirryTest.kt).
