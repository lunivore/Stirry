# Stirry
A very lightweight JavaFX automation tool.

Current features:

- Find the root node of your app, or modal dialogs
- Find any other node using predicates
- Wait for nodes to be in a particular state, returning any arbitrary result you like
- Wait for text property changes (faster)

Examples of how to use it are [here](src/test/kotlin/com/lunivore/stirry/).
